			"problem": "Most task managers are either too simple (lacking features) or too complex (overwhelming users). Finding the right balance between power and simplicity is challenging.",
			"solution": "Created a feature-complete task manager with advanced functionality (drag-and-drop, recurring tasks, subtasks) wrapped in an intuitive, clean interface that doesn't overwhelm users.",
			"impact": "Users can manage complex projects with 15+ features including subtasks, recurring tasks, bulk actions, and undo support while maintaining a simple, fast experience across all devices.",
			"problemGoal": [
				"Many task management apps either lack essential features or overwhelm users with complexity. Simple to-do lists don't scale for serious work, while enterprise tools have steep learning curves and subscription fees.",
				"I wanted to create a solution that provides <strong>advanced functionality</strong> without sacrificing <strong>simplicity and speed</strong>. The goal was to build a <strong>feature-complete</strong> task manager that feels intuitive, while giving me hands-on experience with complex state management, drag-and-drop interactions, and building accessible web applications."

			"process": [
				{
					"number": "1",
					"title": "Planning & Research",
					"description": "I analyzed popular task managers like Todoist, Asana, and Microsoft To Do to identify essential features users expect. I mapped out core functionality including CRUD operations, filtering, search, and data persistence. The architecture was planned around React hooks for state management and localStorage for data persistence, keeping the app completely client-side for privacy and speed."
				},
				{
					"number": "2",
					"title": "Design Philosophy",
					"description": "The visual design prioritizes clarity and efficiency. I used Bootstrap 5 as a foundation with custom CSS variables for theming. The color palette features a vibrant blue (#3b82f6) as the primary color, complemented by semantic colors for priorities and status indicators. Every UI element was designed to provide immediate visual feedback, from hover states to completion animations, making the app feel responsive and alive."

			"challenges": [
				{
					"title": "Complex State Management",
					"problem": "Managing multiple interconnected states (tasks, filters, selections, modals) became increasingly complex as features were added. Deep nesting and prop drilling made the code hard to maintain.",
					"solution": "Created custom hooks (useLocalStorage, useKeyboardShortcuts) to encapsulate logic and implemented a clear state architecture with proper data flow. Used React's Context API sparingly and lifted state only when necessary, keeping most state local to components."
				},
				{
					"title": "Drag-and-Drop Performance",
					"problem": "Initial drag-and-drop implementation caused noticeable lag with large task lists (100+ items) and completely broke when filtering was active, as the library lost track of item positions.",
					"solution": "Optimized with proper memoization using React.memo and useCallback. Switched from position-based CSS to transform-based animations for 60fps performance. Fixed filtering issues by ensuring unique IDs and proper SortableContext configuration."
				},
				{
					"title": "Recurring Task Logic",
					"problem": "Generating next occurrences of recurring tasks created infinite loops, duplicate entries, and memory leaks. The useEffect that generated tasks kept triggering itself.",
					"solution": "Built a dedicated utility module with proper date calculations and duplicate detection. Optimized the useEffect dependency array to only run when completed tasks count changed, not on every state update. Added safeguards to prevent infinite generation loops."
				},
				{
					"title": "Accessibility Compliance",
					"problem": "Ensuring keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and WCAG compliance across all features was time-intensive. Modal focus trapping, drag-and-drop keyboard support, and dynamic content announcements required careful implementation.",
					"solution": "Implemented comprehensive ARIA labels, focus management with focus traps for modals, skip links for keyboard users, and keyboard shortcuts with visual indicators. Tested extensively with NVDA and VoiceOver screen readers to ensure full accessibility."
